# poetrySlam

Welcome to my poetry Slam Project! 

INSTRUCTIONS:

This project when ran will show a menu for the user to choose from. 
Out of the three options, the user will enter the number associated with which version of the poem they would like to see. 
Once selected, the program will print out that version and the user gets to enjoy!!

This project was created with Python 3.79.

Other resources: I used stack overflow to understand how to print out the even lines of my .txt file. 
The source can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17908317/python-even-numbered-lines-in-text-file

Hope you enjoy!
